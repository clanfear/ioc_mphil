# The Dissertation

## Dissertation {background-image="img/logo-dark.svg" background-size="auto 60px" background-position="right 15px bottom 15px"}

A high-quality dissertation involves either **reviewing** or **presenting evidence** and thinking in a precise manner, considering alternative arguments, and engaging in critical debate.

* **Reviewing evidence**: Normally library-based
* **Presenting evidence**: Original empirical work^[Including using secondary data]

::: {.center}

&nbsp;

*Empirical research is challenging in a 10 month program. Work with your supervisor to develop a feasible research design.*

   * Common styles: APA, MHRA, Harvard

## Turnitin {background-image="img/logo-dark.svg" background-size="auto 60px" background-position="right 15px bottom 15px"}

> Turnitin compares the text of submitted work to sources in its database, which is made up of internet content, selected journals, and previous student submissions. The software then provides an originality report, which identifies the extent of matched text by highlighting the matches and providing an overall percentage match. Reports will be scrutinised by an academic member of staff, who will review the report to determine whether the matches may indicate wider concerns around poor scholarly technique or an attempt to gain unfair advantage, and whether any further action should be taken.

## Generative AI {background-image="img/logo-dark.svg" background-size="auto 60px" background-position="right 15px bottom 15px"}

> We also carry out checks to identify the use of Generative AI in writing essays. A student using any unacknowledged content generated by artificial intelligence or other software (e.g. ChatGPT, Grammarly) within a summative assessment, as though it is their own work, constitutes **academic misconduct**. When submitting your assignments and dissertation you will be required to confirm on your essay and dissertation submission forms what, if any, AI programmes or similar tools you used in your writing process and how they were used.
