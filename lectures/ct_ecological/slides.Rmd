# Boudon—Coleman Boat

Most ecological theories focus on environmental causes and aggregate outcomes (macro-level), but crime happens in situations (micro-level)

--

The **Coleman** boat or **Boudon-Coleman** boat is used to illustrate causal mechanisms (arrows) linking micro (e.g., individual) and macro (e.g., neighborhood) variables<br>

## The Experiments

Over 2000 person-hours of **field experiments**, conducted over four years, embedded in representative Seattle neighbourhoods with rich **ecological survey data** (2002-2003 SNCS)

* Balance strengths and weaknesses of experimental and observational methods

* Maximize internal and external validity


--



&zwj;1. **Lost Letter**: Collective efficacy &#8594; prosocial behaviour

&zwj;2. **Mailbox Experiment**: Disorder &#8594; crime

&zwj;3. **Littering Intervention**: Disorder &#8594; sanctioning

&zwj;4. **Litter Clean-Up**: Collective efficacy &#8594; disorder removal

# Lost Letter Experiment

Collective efficacy is a capacity for **pro-social behavior**.

--

Therefore we can get a proxy measure using actual pro-social behavior.

--

Replication of [Milgram et al. (1965)](https://doi.org/10.1086/267344) and [Sampson (2012)](https://www.press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/G/bo5514383.html).


--

2,938 letters were dropped on Seattle sidewalks for passersby to encounter.


--

24 letters—8 per addressee—were dropped in each census tract:
  * Charles F. Landers Sr. (Personal)
  * Friends of Black Lives Matter (BLM)
  * American Neo-Nazi Party (Nazi)


--

Mailed letters were received at a PO Box monitored by the research team.

Letters were numbered and geocoded to drop locations.

Key Findings:

* Disorder has no impact on theft.


--

* Disorder reduces the likelihood of mailing—resulting in the letter remaining on the ground longer.


--

* Collective efficacy is associated with lower theft, but not more mailing.

# The Littering Intervention


&zwj;Objective: Causal test of direct effect of disorder on sanctioning (B).

&nbsp;

.image-62[
![](img/littering_intervention_1.svg)

---

## Littering Intervention: Method

A confederate walks down the street and flagrantly litters in view of passersby near a trash can with a no-littering sign.<sup>1</sup>

.footnote[[1] Or perhaps hits their dog with garbage.
<br>
]

--

Researchers record if confederate is sanctioned—**risky prosocial behavior**—or litter disposed of by participant—**low-risk prosocial behavior**. *Content* of sanction is also recorded.

--

Litter and a sign board with graffiti are introduced to manipulate disorder.

--

Replicated with three confederates of varying gender and race to manipulate interpersonal context which may influence evaluations of risk:<sup>2</sup>
   * Black Man
   * White Man
   * White Woman

.footnote[[2] Gender and race also relate to normative expectations.]

--

We conducted 576 trials in 12 Seattle census tracts.

???

8 trials per person per condition in 12 tracts. 8 x 2 x 3 x 12

We also evaluated if our interventions impacted throwing away the dropped litter—a low risk, non-confrontational prosocial action.

--

* Disorder treatment reduces throwing away.

    * This effect also conditional on confederate characteristics.

### Collective efficacy vs. social disorganization

>  ‘[Collective efficacy] accepts the basic idea of Social
Disorganization theory that social control is a collective
challenge not attributable to the characteristics of individuals
alone and that it constitutes a major source of variation in
crime rates (Sampson 2012)

&nbsp;

> ‘[Collective efficacy] relaxe[s] the traditional
disorganization assumption that the ideal contextual setting for
social control is necessarily one characterized by dense,
intimate, and strong neighbourhood ties (e.g., through friends
or kin) (Sampson 2012)
